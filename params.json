(cf http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=1095)\r\n\r\n![preview](http://github.com/dexnode/ht1632c-arduino-web-interface/blob/master/preview.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n=============\r\n\r\n- Arduino Mega 2560\r\n- Ethernet Shield\r\n- 1 or 2 HT1632 RG Bicolor Led Matrix boards (might support up to 4 boards)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n- HT1632C library forked by flavio-fernandes (https://github.com/flavio-fernandes/HT1632-for-Arduino)\r\n- webduino library\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions to edit the ht1632.h file in the HT1632 library. This is needed so it can find out it is a bicolor board and the number of boards as well.\r\n\r\nOpen h1632c-arduino-web-ui.ino and edit the arduino ip address\r\n\r\nUpload to your Arduino\r\n\r\nOpen your browser and enter the address http://{your-arduino-ip-addres}/index.html\r\n\r\nExplanation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis web interface opens a http server on the arduino. Then you can access it from your browser and change the text on the display. It allows 2 lines editing of 1 to 4 boards and have blinking and scrolling options.\r\n\r\nBugs & Features\r\n===============\r\n\r\nLooks like both the HT1632 and ethernet libraries need to much SRAM memory so it can run on the Arduino Uno.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Using both blinking and scrolling on the two lines at the same makes the animation a little bit slower the more boards you have.\r\n\r\nFuture Plans\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Add variables such as date, time, count and countdown minutes\r\n- Automatic Switch on and switch off with default messages on display.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
